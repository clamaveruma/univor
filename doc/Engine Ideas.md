# Engine ideas
## VM descriptor

The descriptor object stores:
 - The name: path and name
 - Its own local config  .local_config
 - The connector to the VM  .MV
    - operations are done in that: e.g. descip1.VM.start()
 
 - The VM_id: generated by the hypervisor. If Provisioned =None
 - A state: Provisioned, Crated, Unreachable
 - Last Error. Stores the last error or warning on None
 - Last operation. Metadata of last operation on the descriptor

 - Mark when a operation is being executed, only for async tasks. Only in memory, not saved on disk.



## Operations
An operation has a target object, or more than one, e.g., some VM descriptors.
The is a operations Queue, with requests and results. That Queue has some 

Metadata of operations is logged. The operation and the result.



I am thinking in this: When a client sends a command ( any kind), inernally, a command object is created, with a unique command number. It is an async operation, usually. So It returns the command number, and a message like "pending". The engine tries to execute the command.
For the sync commands: return the result, or warning or error.
For async commands: when done, store the result in a Results Queue.
 If success, it stores the result in the Executed commands Queue. Also a small line to the log, just with the metadata of the command
